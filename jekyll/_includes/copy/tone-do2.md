Here the page is rewritten to explain the error in human terms: Firefox is having trouble finding a site rather than the server being unable to resolve the address. The illustration and the word “hmm” provide a bit of personality while signaling to the user that the situation is not dangerous. And, the user is provided with recommended actions.
